This is a toy project using [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/). Inspired by Wired's [5-Levels](https://www.wired.com/video/series/5-levels), where any topic from the user is turned into a 5-level explainer progressing from a child's reading level up to to an expert scientist.  My personal goals for this project are..

1. Develop an understanding of agentic workflows
2. Identify common design patterns for prompts & agents
3. Distill it into a short(ish) demo for work and elsewhere
